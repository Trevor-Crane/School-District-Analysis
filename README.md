 # School-District-Analysis

## Overview of School District Analysis
Initially, we were given data to help analyze student funding and students standardized test scores. This would help with the making of school budgets and priorites for the school district. However, with evidence of academic dishonesty, we are tasked with updating our analysis, and see how these changes may have affected our initial analysis.
